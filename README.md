# cyberpunk2020-custom
Custom Cyberpunk rules. Started with Ocelot's Character Generation System v3.4.  
Customized, formatted, and cloneable in markdown by Seth Timmons.  

## SUMMARY
The following information details an alternate character creation process designed for use with Cyberpunk 2020. It incorporates new rules for buying skills, creating older characters, an advantage and disadvantage system, and a new way to figure out starting funds. Character roles are not used. This will allow responsible players more flexibility with character creation.

Any part of this system can be adapted for GMs and players who wish to keep using the regular CP2020 system roles. The elimination of roles is not an essential part of this system, although it is an important step, and the rest of this variation will assume that they are not in use. Feel free to use whichever parts you feel comfortable with.

This edition (version 3.31) has been updated slightly. This is reflected in a more standardized cost system for advantages and disadvantages, as well as several new advads and disads. Many of the old advantages and disadvantages have been reworked and/or clarified. Some of the lifepath details have been altered slightly, and I've made a few additions. Overall, things work just like they used to. There's just a little bit more to work with.

### ATTRIBUTES
Attributes are generated in any of the methods listed in the CP2020 rulebook. In my case, I roll 6D10+30, and distribute the points. No attribute may be greater than 10 or lower than 2. Alternately, for a grittier, more down-to-earth feel, give players 54 points to allocate to the nine attributes. They'll hate you for it, trust me.

### LIFEPATH
A character's lifepath can be generated in any way the player or GM sees fit. I have included my own lifepath charts later in this document. I generally use these charts before skill points are assigned, since certain results may affect which skills, advantages, or disadvantages I take. Usually, I offer the lifepath to players as an option. Since some of the entries can be quite permanent, like the occasional "Disaster Strikes !" result, some players are uncomfortable with the uncertainty involved. Another option is to let players roll on the chart as many or as few times as they want, within the guidelines of the character's age. It helps if they state how many rolls they will make. The GM should enforce the player's decision.

### SKILLS
In CP2020, characters receive 40 SP's to be distributed among 10 Career skills and the total of their INT+REF to be spent on Pick-Up Skills.

In this modified system, characters still receive the base 40 SP's, but they do not have to spend these skills on a "Career Package", since there are no Roles. Points can be spent on any skill desired. 

Pick-Up Skill Points are granted depending on age (in lieu of INT+REF=Pick-Up SP's), and since older characters should be far more experienced than younger ones, the number of Pick-Up SP's increases with age. Pick-Up SP's can also be spent on any skill.

**Here's how it works:**

    Age				SP's Per Year	TSPs  
    12				5		 		-15 
    13				5		 		-10
    14				4		 		-5
    15				4		 		-1
    16				3		 		+3
    17				3		 		+6
    18				3		 		+9
    19				3		 		+12
    20				2		 		+14
    21				2		 		+16
    22				2		 		+18
    23				2		 		+20
    24				1		 		+21
    25				1		 		+22
    26				1		 		+23
    27				1		 		+24
    28				1		 		+25
    
For every year after 28, add one more SP to the running Total Skill Points (TSP's). For instance, a 25-year old character in CP2020 with a REF+INT total of 12 will receive 12 pick-up skill points, in addition to his 40-point career package. In this version, the same character will have a lump sum of 62 skill points, which can be spent on any skill in the master list. This may seem like a large increase, but it allows players to tailor their characters to their own design, as opposed to using stock career skills which can limit character individuality. Note that a younger character has much fewer points to spend on skills than his older counterparts. A sixteen year-old weeflerunner will be much less experienced, and this reflects in his whopping total of 43 Skill Points.

This grants a great deal of freedom in the skill choices a player must make, allowing them to create monster characters with skills of 8 or more. This should be discouraged, since this defeats the purpose of building a unique character who will stand out from the rest of the pack as an individual. I prefer to restrict players to a skill level ceiling of 6, which is an impressive skill level in and of itself. I consider characters with skill levels of 7 or higher to be masters in their chosen fields, and as such, they should be few and far between.

### IT'S NOT THE YEARS, IT'S THE MILEAGE
Characters older than 28 are reaching the twilight of their days. They are by no means young any more, and the reflexes, stamina, and speed they possessed at age 21 might feel a bit rusty, chipped, and worn. Starting at age 30, the player picks either REF, MA, or BOD, and rolls 1d10. If the result is equal to or lower than the unmodified stat (no bonuses for cyberware, drugs, etc.), the character loses 1 point in it. The lower the stat becomes, the harder it will be to lose points in it. This occurs again every two years until age 40. After that, roll every one year until age 55. After 55, roll twice a year. A player cannot roll against the same stat twice consecutively. If any stat reaches 1, the character is crippled. If it dips down to 0, he dies.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES
As for special abilities, there are none. I wanted to steer clear of a class-based system, and since special abilities are based on roles, most of them have been removed from this version of Cyberpunk. These include Authority, Charismatic Leadership, Combat Sense, Credibility, Family, Jury Rig, Resources and Streetdeal, as well as the lesser ones which have been included in other supplements.

However, I have kept two special abilities : Interface and Medtech. There are no other skills to replace them. The closest thing to Medtech is First Aid, and it's just not potent enough. I've placed it under the Tech skills... anyone can buy it by putting points into it. Interface was also an important skill, since nothing else covers that aspect of the genre. Anyone can jack into the 'Net with the proper training. Interface merely represents the skill that one wields there. As with Medtech, Interface can be bought by anyone willing to spend the points. It's been placed under the Intelligence skills, by the way. Some special abilities are available to any character in the form of certain advantages which can be bought during character creation. Note that these advantages aren't as powerful as the Special Abilities they represent.

### MONEY & EQUIPMENT
How do you figure out how much money a character starts off with now, since there are no special abilities to gauge the price of his services ? Take the character's INT and LUCK scores and add them together. Divide by 2, and multiply the result by 1000. This is the amount of euro the character has in savings, to buy weapons and cyberware with, etc. It generally gives those players who tend to have characters with low scores in INT and LUCK something to think about. For example, you have a character with an INT of 7 and a Luck of 4. His total starting moneys will equal 5500 euro (7+4/2=5.5Ã—1000=5500).

There is one more money option... I allow players to spend AP's to buy equipment money. In other words, if a player wants more money to juggle, he/she can "buy" it by taking a point off of an attribute. For each point they "spend", they get $1000 in equipment, cyberware, etc. What they don't spend, they lose. I allow for a maximum of 10 points to be spent. This tends to result in a character who is better equipped, but less powerful attribute-wise, which can be a good trade in some cases. As a case in point, you wanted your character in the previous example to own a fairly nice car, as opposed to a Honda Metrocar or a New American Motors Crowder. You know that 5500 bucks isn't going to cut it, so you drop your MA and BOD by two points each, gaining 4000 euro more to spend. This leaves you with a clean 9500 to sink into the car of your dreams.

### ATTRIBUTE SAVES
Attribute Saves are rolls made against attributes in circumstances that do not dictate a skill roll. Saves are made by choosing the appropriate attribute, and rolling 1D10 equal to or below the stat's total. If the roll is higher, it has failed. Difficulties for rolls may vary, and that is reflected in the following chart. These modifiers are subtracted from the attribute in question.

Difficulty			Modifier
easily				+2
average				+0
Difficult			-2
Very Difficult		-4
Near Impossible		-6
Impossible			-8

### ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES
Advantages and Disadvantages are bought using Skill Points (SPs  

I have found that limiting players to between 6 and 10 points of disadvantages keeps them from going completely crazy, as is wont to happen in one-shot games where players aren't usually worried about the long-term effects that certain disads will cause them.

Some disadvantages can, if allowed by the GM, be "bought off" using IPs. The cost for buying off a disadvantage is the point cost times 10. For example, buying off the Cowardice disadvantage would cost 40 IPs (4 x 10 = 40). The GM should not allow players to buy off disads without making them work at it, though. Buying off any mental disadvantage may take weeks of psychological therapy which is both time consuming and costly, while replacing a character's missing legs will require either cloned organics, or cybernetic replacements. You be the judge, and don't let them get away with anything. Advantages cannot normally be bought after character creation unless an act of God permits it.

### AN EXAMPLE OF A CHARACTER
Below, you will find a sample character, the first made with standard CP2020 rules, and the second with the modifications. Note that this character does not have a lifepath. We'll call him "Leon".

Leon grew up in a neighborhood that was once clean and upstanding, but had in years recent to his birth begun to decline into lower-end housing. His father worked as a manager at a local grocery store, and his mother sold real estate for Century 22 Realtors. As he grew up, he was constantly picked on and bullied because he was short and pudgy. Being the youngest and smallest of three boys didn't help.

During his youth, he spent most of his time alone. For his eleventh birthday, his parents bought him an early-model cybermodem - clunky and slow - but Leon didn't care. He was free to explore a world where his physical weaknesses weren't part of the equation. However, he soon learned that he wasn't able to compete in Netspace, either. He didn't think fast enough, and his parents were too poor to help him upgrade his modem, which was quickly becoming obsolete.

He began to work on strengthening himself, girding for the storm of high school, where the bullies were even bigger, and stabbings in the cafeteria were a constant danger. As he worked out, first with simple calisthenics and later in the high school's decaying weight room, he felt his muscles growing. A small, shy, weak little boy had been replaced by a strong, confident, energetic young man.

After graduation, Leon sought work in the security industry. He was hired by a company called Arasaka, and utilizing his past experience with netrunning and computers, they trained him has an electronic security specialist.

-----------------------

If you compare Leon V1 to Leon V2, you'll see several slight differences. By reading Leon's history, you see that I wanted a character with a decent amount of knowledge in computers and netrunning, but that I didn't want a full-blown netrunner. His skills had to reflect on his desire to be strong and in control of his body (ie, high athletics and, in V2, strength feat), but they also had to include his knowledge of netrunning and cyberspace particulars (interface, system knowledge, etc.).

Using the stock system, I found it difficult to encompass all the qualities that I wanted in Leon. The solo career package gave him plenty of combat-related skills, but little to no technical skills (where his real talents are). His REF+INT are only equal to 12, so the computer- and technical-related skills required by his concept had to be kept at fairly low levels. Since I was unable to spread his base 40 points among more than ten fixed skills, I found myself lumping them into skills (ie, weaponsmith, submachinegun, and stealth) that I didn't really see Leon needing to reflect on his history.

Without the restriction of character roles in V2, I had no trouble trying to decide which would suit my needs better, a solo or a netrunner. I could pick and choose the skills I needed to make Leon an individual (as opposed to just another solo with a couple of pick-up skills). Not only that, but by gaining pick-up skills on the basis of age as opposed to his REF+INT total, Leon is wiser and more experienced than some seventeen year-old with abnormally high attributes and the attitude to back them up.

### ADVANTAGE LIST
What follows is a list of the advantages available in this version of Cyberpunk. Some of them emulate certain special abilities from Cyberpunk 2020, while most of them reflect on a certain excellent quality or aptitude a character exhibits. Advantages can only be bought during character creation using Skill Points.

**Acute Sense (varies)**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
When a player selects this advantage, he also selects one of his five senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, or touch). Awareness rolls made that involve that kind of stimulus receive a +2 bonus. Any cybernetic options that alter or replace the specified sensory organs (replacing eyes with cyberoptics, for example) will nullify this advantage in regards to that sense. If only one eye is replaced, the bonus is reduced to +1; if a limb is replaced with a cybernetic part, the bonus no longer applies to touch-based rolls with that arm. Sensory organs modified by nanotech augmentation are only adversely affected 10% of the time. This advantage may be taken up to five times, once for each of the senses.

**Ambidextrous**  
**Cost:** 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character can function equally well using either hand (no off-hand firing modifier), though penalties for multiple actions still apply.

**Artistic**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
Artistic characters are naturally drawn (pun intended) to art, be it painting, drawing, sculpting, or some other physical medium of expression. While their art may not speak to all who observe it, it is unquestionably of high quality. Artistic characters get a +2 bonus to Paint or Draw and Forgery skill rolls.

**Athletic**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
An athletic character is especially in tune with his body. This grants a +2 bonus to Athletics, Dance and Dodge & Escape skill rolls. This bonus is also applied to Martial Arts maneuvers such as Dodge and Escape.

**Balance**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character will not suffer from dizziness due to changes in orientation, which translates into a +2 on space sickness rolls, an automatic +1 skill in 0-Gee Maneuver and a +2 bonus to any athletic skill involving extended balance.

**Bilingual Background**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character grew up speaking two languages. This grants him an additional language at +8.

**Born Healer**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character has natural aptitudes with healing the sick and injured. This grants him a +2 bonus when using skills such as First Aid, MedTech and Diagnose Illness.

**Brawny**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
Strong characters are better able to employ their muscles for lifting and carrying. When calculating how much a Strong character may carry or dead lift, act as if their Body attribute is 2 points higher than it actually is. This advantage also grants a +2 bonus to any Strength Feat skill rolls the character makes.

**Brotherhood**  
**Cost:** Variable (voir Annexe 1)  
**Description:**  
You are a member or close associate of a cohesive group of people. Such groups include nomad packs, gangs, workgangs, pirate groups, etc. Brotherhood defines rank, clout and the ability to call on the group's resources. There are three separate types of brotherhood : Family (nomads), Blood (gang members) and Workgang (for orbital and subaquatic workgangs). For more information, see the cost charts in the appendix.

**Chemical Youth**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character with this advantage, either through his unique psychology or physiology, is less likely to become dependant on drugs and alcohol. As such, he gains a +2 bonus on any addiction saves he makes. This assumes that the rules in Ocelot's Drug Lab are being used.

**Combat Reflexes**  
**Cost:** 2, 4, 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
For each level of Combat Reflexes bought, the character will gain a +1 to his Initiative rolls (up to the maximum of +3). This acts as the "Combat Sense" special ability in that respect only.

**Combat Reflexes (Net)**  
**Cost:** 2, 4, 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
For each level of Net Combat Reflexes bought, the character gets a +1 bonus to his initiative in the 'Net (up to the maximum of +3).

**Competent**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
A Competent character rarely screws up. If a character with this advantage rolls a "1" on a skill roll, he may roll two additional D10s when determining if the roll is a fumble and choose the most beneficial result.

**Computer Aptitude**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
This advantage entitles the character to an uncanny ability to operate computers, both in and out of netspace. This grants a bonus of +2 when using Cyberdeck Design, Interface, Library Search (computers only), Programming and System Knowledge.

**Connoisseur**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character who is a Connoisseur knows and appreciates the finer things in life. He is familiar with the finest wines and foods, the most prestigious designer drugs and the best cosmetics, jewelry and clothing. His extensive knowledge grants him a +2 bonus on Social rolls when trying to impress upper echelon movers and shakers, as well as a +2 bonus to Streetwise rolls made to procure such goods on the black and gray markets.

**Contacts**  
**Cost:** Variable (voir Annexe 2)
**Description:**  
Contacts are people that characters can use as information sources, or can contact for goods and services. The number of points spent on a contact reflects the value of that contact's skill, reputation, availability and reliability. Contacts are likely to become unhappy if used quite often and may request information or services from the characters as well. For more information, see the cost charts in the appendix.

**Cool Under Fire**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character who is Cool Under Fire never suffers skill roll penalties (CP2020 v2.01, page 42) when Under Stress or Under Attack.

**Cyber-Affinity**  
**Cost:** 10 SPs  
**Description:**  
This rare and extremely valuable advantage grants a character 15 points of Humanity Cost (HC) per Empathy point versus the normal 10. This allows him to graft more cyberware into and onto his body than a normal human being. This is a powerful advantage and should not be handed out without forethought on the part of the GM.

**Danger Sense**  
**Cost:** 2, 4, 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
For each level of Danger Sense bought, the character will gain a +1 on awareness checks when his life is on the line (up to a maximum of +3). This acts as the "Combat Sense" special ability in this respect only.

**Direction Sense**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
This is the equivalent of an internal compass. The character, at any time, can make an average awareness roll to determine his facing.

**Double-Jointed**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character's body has more flexibility than average. This grants a +4 bonus to all Dodge & Escape skill rolls and might assist in any physical activity that requires contortions (squeezing into a small box, pulling your body through a toilet seat lid, etc.).

**Eidetic Memory**  
**Cost:** 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character has a "photographic" memory. He can remember anything he has seen, learned or heard by making an average awareness roll.

**Empathy**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is good at reading emotions and understanding people. This grants an automatic +2 to his Human Perception rolls and +1 to other Empathy-related skills.

**Fashion Victim**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character with this advantage can make anything look stylish and hip through sheer talent. This grants a +2 bonus to all Personal Grooming and Wardrobe & Style skill rolls.

**Fast**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
Quick characters add 3 points to their effective Run score. These additional points do not affect the character's Leap score, which should be calculated using the character's unmodified Run total.

**Favor**  
**Cost:** 2, 4, 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is owed a favor by someone. The favor's impact depends on the level of the advantage. Calling in the favor is a one-time deal. Once used, the debt is null and void. Depending on both the ethics of the owing party, as well as the state of the relationship between the two parties, this advantage can present opportunities for deep role-play. Note that the NPCs who owe these favors must be relatively anonymous (for example, a mid-level executive of Militech might owe you a favor, but not a member of the board of directors). If the GM wishes, he can increase the cost of the favor by between 2 and 4 extra points depending on who owes it to the player.
At 2 points, the favor is relatively minor and the person who owes the favor won't risk his life/livelihood to perform it (a policeman ignoring a minor weapons violation, a prostitute giving a "freebie", a friend letting you sack out on his sofa for a month or so, etc.). The monetary value of the favor can't be more than 200 to 300 eurobucks.
At 4 points, the favor carries a bit more weight. The person owing the favor will risk his livelihood/job, though not necessarily his life, to come through for the character that he owes (a policeman looking the other way or falsifying a report, a mechanic botching a repair job on your enemy's car, a clerk or official photocopying sensitive documents), etc. The monetary value of the favor can't be more than 1000 eurobucks.
At 6 points, the person owes you his life. The person owing the favor is honor-bound to risk both his life and livelihood in order to come to the character's aid. The monetary value of this level is debatable.

**Friends**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
For each Friend bought, the character has a Friend as per "Make a Friend" on the Lifepath chart. Friends are different from Contacts, in that they (Friends) will (generally) put their life on the line for you, whereas Contacts will only supply information, services, or goods. Friends are considered to be on a par, skill and ability-wise, with a starting PC.

**Hard Hitting**  
**Cost:** 4, 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character with this advantage knows where to strike opponents in unarmed or melee combat (specify which). This has the game effect of increasing the character's hand-to-hand damage bonus by +1. For 6 points, this bonus damage applies to damage from both unarmed and melee attacks.

**Hard To Kill**  
**Cost:** 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
Like Steven Seagal, the character with this advantage is hard to kill. As such, he gets a +1 bonus to any Death Saves he must make.

**High Pain Threshold**  
**Cost:** 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character can tolerate pain better than most people. After taking damage, he gains a +1 to his Stun/Shock Saves, as well as a +2 bonus to Resist Torture/Drugs when pain is involved (ie, this won't help if truth serums are used, only torture).

**Human Calculator**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character with this advantage can do complicated mathematics in his head. This grants a +2 bonus to all Accounting, Gamble, Mathematics and Programming skill rolls.

**Imposing**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
An Imposing character looks like trouble. Whether he is or not is up to the character's player. This is reflected in a +2 bonus to all Intimidation skill checks, as well as +2 to any Reputation rolls made during a facedown.

**Lady Killer**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
This a specialized form of the Empathy advantage which reflects the character's uncanny ability to seduce members of the opposite sex (or the same sex, depending on orientation). Don't let the name fool you... this advantage can be taken by both sexes. It entitles the character to a +2 bonus to all Seduction rolls and a +1 bonus to all other Empathy-based skills when used against the opposite sex (the girls just can't say no!).

**Light Sleeper**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
With this advantage, a character may make Awareness rolls while asleep (at the GM's discretion).

**Lucky**  
**Cost:** 2, 4, 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character who is Lucky gets a number of extra Luck points each game and these points can be spent just like normal Luck points. Note that this advantage doesn't affect the character's actual Luck score. For every 2 points spent on this advantage, the character gets an extra Luck point.

**Marksman**  
**Cost:** 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character with the Marksman advantage has a natural talent with one type of ranged weapon (specify : archery, handgun, heavy weapon, submachine gun, rifle, etc.), specified at the time that the advantage is purchased.

### DISADVANTAGE LIST
Disadvantages represent faults or defects that some characters have. Some are physical, while others are mental. Disadvantages, depending on their severity, can be permanent, but they don't have to be. Most can be bought off with IP's later in the character's life. If a disadvantage is bought off, the player and GM should work out the details. The change should by no means be sudden, or happen overnight, without some major external influence (for example, surgery or personality adjustment). Disadvantages are severe flaws that have a profound impact on a character, and should not be done away with lightly.

A final note on disadvantages. Characters are not required to have any at all. Though you may want to play a character who is quite honorable and trustworthy, it doesn't mean you must buy the Honor disadvantage. Buying the disadvantage merely forces you to role-play it under any and every circumstance. Playing an honorable character without the disad means he isn't forced to do something he'd rather not do.

**Acute Sense (varies)**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**  
When a player selects this advantage, he also selects one of his five senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, or touch). Awareness rolls made that involve that kind of stimulus receive a +2 bonus. Any cybernetic options that alter or replace the specified sensory organs (replacing eyes with cyberoptics, for example) will nullify this advantage in regards to that sense. If only one eye is replaced, the bonus is reduced to +1; if a limb is replaced with a cybernetic part, the bonus no longer applies to touch-based rolls with that arm. Sensory organs modified by nanotech augmentation are only adversely affected 10% of the time. This advantage may be taken up to five times, once for each of the senses.

**Favor**  
**Cost:** 2, 4, 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is owed a favor by someone. The favor's impact depends on the level of the advantage. Calling in the favor is a one-time deal. Once used, the debt is null and void. Depending on both the ethics of the owing party, as well as the state of the relationship between the two parties, this advantage can present opportunities for deep role-play. Note that the NPCs who owe these favors must be relatively anonymous (for example, a mid-level executive of Militech might owe you a favor, but not a member of the board of directors). If the GM wishes, he can increase the cost of the favor by between 2 and 4 extra points depending on who owes it to the player.
At 2 points, the favor is relatively minor and the person who owes the favor won't risk his life/livelihood to perform it (a policeman ignoring a minor weapons violation, a prostitute giving a "freebie", a friend letting you sack out on his sofa for a month or so, etc.). The monetary value of the favor can't be more than 200 to 300 eurobucks.
At 4 points, the favor carries a bit more weight. The person owing the favor will risk his livelihood/job, though not necessarily his life, to come through for the character that he owes (a policeman looking the other way or falsifying a report, a mechanic botching a repair job on your enemy's car, a clerk or official photocopying sensitive documents), etc. The monetary value of the favor can't be more than 1000 eurobucks.
At 6 points, the person owes you his life. The person owing the favor is honor-bound to risk both his life and livelihood in order to come to the character's aid. The monetary value of this level is debatable.

**Friends**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
For each Friend bought, the character has a Friend as per "Make a Friend" on the Lifepath chart. Friends are different from Contacts, in that they (Friends) will (generally) put their life on the line for you, whereas Contacts will only supply information, services, or goods. Friends are considered to be on a par, skill and ability-wise, with a starting PC.

**Hard Hitting**  
**Cost:** 4, 6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character with this advantage knows where to strike opponents in unarmed or melee combat (specify which). This has the game effect of increasing the character's hand-to-hand damage bonus by +1. For 6 points, this bonus damage applies to damage from both unarmed and melee attacks.

**Lady Killer**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
This a specialized form of the Empathy advantage which reflects the character's uncanny ability to seduce members of the opposite sex (or the same sex, depending on orientation). Don't let the name fool you... this advantage can be taken by both sexes. It entitles the character to a +2 bonus to all Seduction rolls and a +1 bonus to all other Empathy-based skills when used against the opposite sex (the girls just can't say no!).

**Light Sleeper**  
**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**

**Cost:** 2 SPs  
**Description:**

A character with this advantage can never have an Attractiveness score higher than 6 or lower than 5 (ie, dead average). If the character's Attractiveness attribute changes for better or worse, the benefit of this advantage is lost.

**Description:**  
When this advantage is selected, the player must select a single skill. This single skill can be increased (through experience) to a maximum rating of 12 instead of 10. Although not immediately beneficial to a starting character (especially if the GM limits starting skill totals), this is still a powerful advantage.

**Technical Aptitude**  
**Cost:** 4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is good with fixing things and therefore gains a +2 bonus when using skills such as Aero Tech, AV Tech, Basic Tech, Cybertech and Gyro Tech. Note that this is NOT a bonus skill level and has no effect on medical skills.

**Cost:** -2, -4, -8 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is allergic to some substance or another :
At -2, the character must make a Body save at -2, or he will experience unpleasant symptoms, such as sneezing, itching, etc. This might modify skill rolls (ie, -2 to Handgun for stinging, watering eyes, etc).
At -4, the character will experience more severe symptoms, including high fever and respiratory distress. The character must make a Body save at -4. If the roll is failed, all skills will be lowered by half until the substance causing the attack is removed.
At -8, the character may have more severe reactions (ie, coma, vomiting and death). A save must be made as per the -4 allergic disadvantage, but at a -6 modifier.

**Bad Temper**  
**Cost:** -2, -4 SPs  
**Description:**

**Description:**  
The character is blind in one or both eyes.
At -4 and -6, the blindness is confined to one eye of the character's choice. This damage can be "bought off" at -4 (this involves replacement of the eye through organic or cybernetic parts), but not at -6. Having only one eye incurs a penalty of -2 to any action involving depth perception.
At -8 SPs  
If bought at -12 SPs  

**Close Personal Tie**  
**Cost:** -2, -4 SPs  
**Description:**

Should the Personal Tie die, or become an enemy, severe emotional distress may occur at the GM's discretion. At -2, the Personal Tie is capable of taking care of himself. At -4, the Tie totally relies on the PC for care.

**Clumsy**  
**Cost:** -4, -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is a klutz. At -4 SPs  

**Compulsion**  
**Cost:** -2, -4, -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character with this disadvantage does something compulsively. Such activities might include innocent things like cleaning up after other people, or they may be more self-destructive, such as a gambling or sex addiction.
At -2 points, the compulsion is more of a quirk than anything. It need not disrupt the character's life overmuch and can usually be role-played. If it becomes an issue of concern, the player must make an Average save versus Cool to resist the impulse to indulge in his compulsion.
At -4 points, the compulsion is a serious psychological flaw. Whenever presented with the object of his obsession, the character must make a save versus Cool at -2 or be forced to pursue his compulsion.
At -6 the compulsion is a major problem, obvious to everyone the character meets. When faced with a circumstance relating to his compulsion, a character must make a save versus Cool at -4 to resist the temptation. Even if he resists, he will be obviously uncomfortable as long as he is subjected to the situation.

**Compulsive Liar**  
**Cost:** -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character will lie to hear himself talk. He gets a kick out of spinning tales and it doesn't even matter if the person he's talking to knows he's lying or not. Invariably, it may be hard for the character to find anyone who will believe him at all (ie, The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf). This may mean as much as a -5 modifier to skills such as Fast Talk, Seduction and Oratory if the people he is attempting to con know of his disorder. If the player wants his character to tell the truth, he must make a Save against Cool (at -2), or he will automatically lie.

**Cowardice**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
Any time the character tries to accomplish a task which may cause him physical harm, he must make a Save against Cool at -2 in order to show some guts and stick around. If he fails, he must run or hide, whichever is more convenient.

**Criminal Record**  
**Cost:** -2, -4 or -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character with this disad has been convicted of a crime sometime in his life. At level -2, it's a black mark on his past and it might prevent him from getting certain jobs (employers don't want ex-cons). Also, since he's on a criminal database somewhere, he might be picked up as a suspect in other crimes, whether or not he committed them. This also gives police a reason to harass the character for no reason. At -4, the character is still on parole. He must visit his parole officer once a month, take a drug test each visit and hold down a steady (legitimate) job. At -6, the character is an escaped convict, likely to be gunned down on sight by any police that recognize him. Being caught by police will mean another trip to the pen for an even longer duration.
See appendix 5 for more information about jailpath.

**Cyber-Rejection**  
**Cost:** -10 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character with this disadvantage cannot have any cyberware grafted onto or into his body or his immune system will violently reject it. If a Save against Body (at -4) is made, the Cybernetics will not work and the character will take 2 points of damage daily until they are removed. This damage is cumulative and will not heal. If the roll is failed, the character must make a Death Save once per hour until the cyberware is either removed or the character dies, in addition to taking the 2 points of damage per day.

**Debt (Financial)**  
**Cost:** -2, -4, -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character in question owes someone money. The nature of the debt is up to the player and GM to decide, but it shouldn't be an amount that the player can pay off immediately. This debt need not be based on money, but on equipment that was previously lost or damaged (a car that the PC wrecked, money owed in a court settlement, child support or alimony, etc.). The character need not pay all the money at once, but it must be a constant drain on his resources. Failure to make regular payments can lead to a lousy credit rating, repossession of equipment or property and arrest. The debt amounts are guidelines, subject to the GM's whim and approval. For an additional -2 SPs  
At -2, the character must pay 200 eurodollars a month for a year before the debt is paid off.
At -4, the character must pay 500 eurodollars a month for a year, or 300 eurodollars a month for two years, before the debt is paid off.
At -6, the character must pay 1000 eurodollars a month for a year, or 600 eurodollars a month for two years, before the debt is paid off.

**Deep Sleeper**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is hard to wake up once he is asleep. A Deep Sleeper must succeed at an Intelligence save with a -4 modifier in order to wake up under normal circumstances (their alarm clock is going off, for instance). Loud noises or shaking might reduce this penalty, but will never grant a bonus. For each consecutive round that the disturbance continues, the penalty decreases by one point to a minimum of +0.

**Divided Loyalty**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character has a deep-seated loyalty for something or someone other than his current employer or fellow PCs (a government organization, a corporation, a gang, etc.). The interests of the character's employer (or controller or whatever) may not always be in line with that of the other PCs. The GM should discuss the details with the player prior to play and then plan accordingly. Ignoring this disadvantage is a good way for a PC to end up in deep trouble. Unlike Close Personal Tie, this disadvantage does not necessarily represent a loved one or members of the character's family (though, in some particularly twisted circumstances, it could).

**Domineering**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character with this disadvantage likes to be in charge and will attempt to fill the leadership role in any group. He is bossy, unforgiving of failure and expects those below him to follow his orders to the letter. Domineering people are typically disliked by their underlings. This is reflected in a -2 penalty to any Leadership rolls made by the domineering character against NPCs who are familiar with him.

**Drug Addiction**  
**Cost:** Variable (-2 Ã  -10)
**Description:**  
The cost for a drug addiction is based on the legality of the substance and the total cost per dose. Something that costs a lot, or is highly illegal, is probably going to be harder to get and the risks involved in keeping your habit are greatly increased. Likewise, something that you can buy at the corner market for five dollars is going to be easier to purchase. When determining the cost of the addiction, cross-index the legality of the substance with the cost of the substance on the following chart :

     Cost			Legal/Common	Prescription	Type C	Type B	Type A
     1-150 euro		    -2				-2				-4		-5		-6
     151-300 euro		-3				-3				-5		-6		-7
     301-450 euro		-4				-4				-6		-7		-8
     451-600 euro		-5				-5				-7		-8		-9
     601-750+ euro		-6				-6				-8		-9		-10

**Ego Signature**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character must leave a "calling card" behind, even during sensitive operations. This can amount to a piece of white lace, a silver bullet, a flower, or a chewed toothpick. Intentionally leaving such clues behind increases the likelihood that the character's identity will be eventually discovered.

**Enemies**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
For each -2 points spent on enemies, the player gets to roll up an enemy on the Friends and Enemies portion of the Lifepath.

**Estranged**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
An estranged character has trouble forming close personal relationships. This is reflected in a -2 penalty to most interpersonal skills (GM's discretion). A character who is Estranged cannot take the Empathy advantage.

**Flashbacks**  
**Cost:** -2, -4, -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character suffers flashbacks from a traumatic experience he had earlier in life. Similar circumstances or stressful situations may trigger these flashbacks.
At -2, the character must make a Save vs. COOL or be stunned for a round.
At -4, he must make the save at -2, or be stunned for 1D5 rounds.
At -6, the character must make the save at -4, or he will begin to hallucinate, thinking that the current situation is, in fact, the old one. He must make a save every 1D10 minutes to "snap out of it", with a +1 modifier every subsequent roll until he recovers. This disadvantage can be "bought off" with IPs if psychological counseling is sought by the character.

**Glass Jaw**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character with this disadvantage is easily knocked out by blows to the head and therefore suffers a -2 to Stun saves after taking such injuries.

**Greedy**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is selfish, miserly and obsessed with money. When offered a bribe, a Save against Cool must be made at a -2 modifier in order not to accept it. In addition, people of this sort are known to betray friends for a few lousy bucks and this may affect reputation as well.

**Hearing Loss/Deafness**  
**Cost:** -2, -4/-6, -8, -10 SPs  
**Description:**  
At -2 SPs, the character is a victim of partial hearing loss in both ears. This results in -2 to all hearing-related Awareness rolls and the damage can be bought off.  
At -4/-6 SPs, the character experiences total deafness in one ear (-4 to all hearing-related Awareness rolls). If at -6, this damage cannot be bought off.  
At -8 SPs, the character is completely deaf in both ears. However, this disad can be bought off as long as costly surgery (involving bio- or cyber- enhancements) is performed as well.  
At -10 SPs, the character is completely deaf in both ears and this damage can't be bought off, no matter what.  

**Hemophilia**  
**Cost:** -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character with this disadvantage has blood that doesn't clot very well. When injured, the character will continue to take one point of damage a round until the bleeding is stopped, or until he dies. This will continue while the character is unconscious, as well.

**Honesty**  
**Cost:** -2, -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
At -2 points, the character won't lie, cheat, steal or break the law unless it is a life-or-death situation.
At -4 points, the character will never behave dishonestly in any way at all, although he may be evasive.

**Honor**  
**Cost:** -2, -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
At -2 points, the character will do anything to accomplish his duty, including placing his life in danger. If it appears as though his acts will bring certain death, he can back out.
At -4 points, the character will go so far as dying if it will accomplish his mission.

**Illiteracy**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character cannot read or write and has trouble with simple math.

**Illness**  
**Cost:** -4, -6, -10 SPs  
**Description:**  
A character with this disadvantage has a chronic disease or illness which cannot be cured through conventional medicine. Such illnesses can include arthritis, migraines, muscular and nervous disorders, diabetes, cancer, etc. Symptoms of specific illnesses should be reflected through play. Medical and trauma team care may be somewhat more expensive for a character with a chronic disease, since his condition requires that special steps be taken when treating him. Illnesses can be "bought off" if the proper treatment is sought during play.
At -4 points, the illness is minor and can be controlled through regular doses of prescribed medication, which can be quite expensive (GM's option). If the medication is not taken, symptoms of the illness will manifest within 1d6 hours. Symptoms can include pain and/or fatigue and should be reflected in a -2 to all skill rolls due to distraction and feelings of ill health.
At -6 points, the illness is somewhat worse. Medication must still be taken to ease the symptoms of the disease, but either the medicine doesn't completely curb the symptoms or the medication itself causes adverse side effects. If the medication is not taken, symptoms will manifest within 1d3 hours, giving the character a -4 to all skill rolls. Even with his medication, a character still suffers a -2 bonus to Initiative, as well as to any other rolls that the GM deems relevant.
At -10 points, the character's illness is terminal and he hasn't got very long to live. The GM should secretly roll 1D10+2 to determine how much longer (in months) the character has to live. For the time being, the character suffers as per the -4 point Illness disadvantage. Once half of this time has passed, his condition worsens to the -6 point Illness disadvantage. After half of his remaining time (be it weeks or months) has passed, the character's condition deteriorates rapidly. Past this point the character is bedridden and no longer viable for standard play. Once his time expires, so does he.

**Impaired Vision**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is a victim of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. This can be corrected by the use of contact lenses or glasses. The defect cannot be repaired completely (ie, cybereyes or organic replacements, or surgery) unless the disad is "bought off" using IPs.

**Impulsive**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
Impulsive characters find talking and planning to be a tedious waste of time, instead preferring to go out and get the job done. They are generally impatient (though this need not always be the case) and grow agitated if things don't seem to be moving as fast as they'd like. GMs should feel free to tempt Impulsive characters into performing rashly.

**Kleptomania**  
**Cost:** -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is a compulsive thief who will steal anything he thinks that he can get away with. What's more, he may not even realize that he's stealing anything until he is caught. When faced with an opportunity for thievery, the player (or the GM, secretly) must make a Save vs. Cool at -2. If the save is failed, the character must make an attempt to swipe the desired object (be it a string of faux pearls or a diamond ring). Failure of the theft roll could lead to incarceration or violent death.

**Lechery**  
**Cost:** -2, -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
At -2 points, the character is drawn to the opposite sex like a moth to a flame. Seduction rolls against this character are made at a +2 bonus to the seducer's roll.
At -4 points, the character is obsessed with sex and will do whatever he can to get the objects of his desire into bed. The character also gets a -2 penalty to all Empathy-based skills when dealing with the opposite sex due to roving eyes and attitude. (Note : If characters are homo- or bisexual, this disadvantage can relate to feelings of the same sex as well.)

**Masochism**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is a masochist and derives pleasure from his own suffering. He will receive +2 to Resist Torture rolls, but may actually go out of his way in order to get hurt. Such methods may include self-mutilation, kinky sex, etc.

**Missing Limbs**  
**Cost:** -4 PCs par membre SPs  
**Description:**  
The character, through defect, mishap, or violence, is missing a limb (the extent of the deformation/injury is subject to discussion and may grant more or less SPs  

**Moral Qualm**  
**Cost:** -2, -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
There is something that the character is morally opposed to doing, such as harming children, lying, or using torture on a prisoner.
At -2, while the character won't actively participate in such activities, he will allow other PCs to indulge.
At -4, the character is so repulsed by the activity that he will take steps to prevent it from happening at all and will not think very highly of those who do.

**Mute**  
**Cost:** -4, -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character cannot talk, due to defect, injury, psychological problems, etc. At -4 SPs  

**Nightmares**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is prone to nightmares. Every time the character tries to sleep, he must roll 1D10. On a result of 1 or 2, he experiences a nightmare which will be of such intensity as to wake him up. He will be unable to sleep the rest of the night. Subsequent nights which yield nightmares as well may incur modifiers to attribute and skill rolls due to exhaustion.

**No Pain Tolerance**  
**Cost:** -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
When the character takes damage, his stun/shock save must be made with a -2 modifier. If the roll is failed, the character is knocked unconscious or incapacitated due to pain (ie, rolling around on the ground screaming). If such a character is the subject of torture, he is likely to snap like a twig (-4 to resist torture).

**Old Injury**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character must roll on the Random Injury Chart and suffer whatever consequences arise. The effects of the injury, regardless of the severity, cannot be corrected until the disadvantage has been "bought off". This disadvantage is a total gamble and should not be taken lightly. Nice GMs might allow players to roll for the injury prior to taking the disadvantage.

**Overconfidence**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character sees himself as better than he truly is. In his eyes he can take on anything and come out without a scratch. This can cause the character to take excessive risks which might get him into more trouble than he's actually worth.

**Pacifism**  
**Cost:** -4, -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
At -4, the character will under no circumstances kill anyone intentionally. Unintentional killing will cause feelings of guilt. The character may still harm opponents, either knocking them unconscious or crippling them.
At -6, the character will not intentionally hurt anyone. Hurting anyone will cause the character grief and killing anyone may cause total mental breakdown.

**Paranoia**  
**Cost:** -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character suffers from a paranoid delusion. Everyone and anyone might be out to get him, even you and he trusts no one. This is a very strong delusion that calls for good role-playing. GMs are encouraged to be fiendish and feed the character's paranoia.

**Phobia**  
**Cost:** -2, -4, -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
At -2 points, the character has a minor fear of an object, animal, or circumstance. When faced with the object of his fear, the character must make a Save vs. COOL or he will refuse to face his fear.
At -4 points, the character must make a Save vs. COOL with a -2 modifier. If he fails, he may panic and try to get away.
At -6 Points, the character must make a Save vs. COOL with a -4 modifier. If failure results, the character may faint or become hysterical. More rolls might be required as the situation dictates.

**Poor Sense (varies)**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
When this disadvantage is taken, the player must specify either his character's sense of smell, taste, or touch. Awareness rolls made that involve the selected sense suffer a -2 penalty.

**Rebellious**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
One of the quintessential features of the stereotypical Cyberpunk character. A rebellious character suffers a -2 to all interpersonal skill rolls when dealing with authority figures (police, government officials, corporate officers, etc.).

**Rival**  
**Cost:** -2, -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
You have a rival, someone who presents legitimate competition in your area of expertise. Your rival should be a fully developed character, with skills and abilities that equal (or, in some cases, exceed) your own. Your rivalry need not be a hostile one, depending on the point cost of the disadvantage.
At -2, your rivalry with this competitor is almost friendly and tainted with professional courtesy. While the two of you aren't friends, you're certainly not enemies. Business, after all, is business.
At -4, your rival has taken a personal interest in making sure that he succeeds at your expense. He sees you as an obstacle to be overcome and he will go out of his way (illegally, if need be) to overshadow you, outbid you for contracts and generally make your business life unpleasant. This competition usually stops short of murder, though he may consider that as an option if the stakes are high enough.

**Sadism**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character gets a kick out of inflicting pain. This sort of character is capable of extreme violence and must make a Save vs. COOL at -2 to keep from attempting to hurt (emotionally or physically) anyone that he has direct power over.

**Sterile**  
**Cost:** -2, -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
For whatever reason the character is unable to sire children.
At -2, the character can still function sexually and retains all of his adult desires and sex drive.
At -4, the character has no carnal desires and is unable to function, which may play havoc with his self-esteem. On the plus side, a character with this form of Sterility is immune to any attempts at Seduction.

**Uncouth**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character is at a loss in any social situation, whether it is meeting a new person or having dinner with the director of your local Arasaka branch. This reflects in a -2 modifier to skills such as Oratory, Interview, Leadership, Seduction, Social and Fast Talk.

**Unmistakable Feature**  
**Cost:** -2 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character has a birthmark, scar, tattoo, or other unusual feature that makes him easily identifiable to others. Note that this can include having an identical twin, or looking just like Marlon Brando. This can be "bought off" using IPs, but should be accompanied by cosmetic surgery.

**Vendetta**  
**Cost:** -2, -4, -6 SPs  
**Description:**  
The character has a score to settle with someone. The way he settles the score isn't important, but he must seek vengeance if the opportunity presents itself unless he makes a save against his COOL -2.
At -2 SPs  
At -4, it's a moderate-sized gang, nomad pack, company, or organization.
At -6, he's after only the largest and/or most powerful group (ie, Arasaka, the IRA, or LEDiv).

**Weak Stomach**  
**Cost:** -4 SPs  
**Description:**  
Anytime the character sees anything disgusting or gross, he must make a Save vs. Cool. If he fails, he will become nauseous, suffering -4 to all skills until he is away from the offending sight. Just seeing blood itself gives him a +2 to his Cool, but stuff like severed heads and mutilated corpses can create a -4 (or worse) modifier.

### CHARTS
The following charts have been designed for use by players in fleshing out the backgrounds of their characters, and could be used instead of the standard CP2020 Lifepath option. They have been created to add more detail to the process of explaining the ups and downs of character life.

#### LIFEPATH CHART
The following series of charts can be used by the GM and his players to generate random histories for player characters. One roll should be made on the chart per year, starting at age 16. Follow the instructions, and proceed to the appropriate sub-charts. If a particular result does not correspond to a player's character concept, feel free to disregard it and roll (or pick) again.

### APPENDIX 1 - Cost Charts for the "Brotherhood" Advantage
When creating a character with Brotherhood, you must first decide what type (Family, Blood, or Workgang) and to what group it is tied to. Once this is accomplished, you check the appropriate column (see below). Each type of Brotherhood has four different aspects, and each aspect has five levels, rated zero through four. Choose which level you wish to have in each aspect, and add them together (you must spend at least 1 point). This will give you an SP cost between 1 and 16 points.  
Depending on the character's affiliation with the group, and the group's relative strength, this number can be fairly high or fairly low. The levels of the separate aspects should be noted, and can only be changed through role-play. No IP may be spent to increase these levels. If not properly maintained, some levels may drop over the course of a game. Increases should be determined by both the GM as well as the player, although the GM's word is final in any dispute.  
Below I've listed the three different Brotherhoods and their different aspects.

    Poor (Gang possesses an old OTV.) 						2
    Comfortable (Gang has a couple different space craft) 	3
    Wealthy (Gang owns a small habitat and several craft) 	4




















### APPENDIX 2 - Cost Charts for the "Contacts" Advantage
There are four aspects that Contacts are rated by. When you buy a contact, you choose one of four levels in each aspect. When you've picked which stat levels you want, you add the point total together (with a minimum value of 1 point). This gives you the final Skill Point (SP) cost of the contact, which will be between 1 and 12 points.



**Contact Skill Level**  

    Skill Level					Cost
    Unskilled    (05+1D10)		0
    Average      (10+1D10)		1
    Professional (15+1D10)		2
    Expert       (20+1D10)		3

Skill Level defines the contact's abilities at his chosen profession. An Unskilled contact has very little training and/or ability in his chosen field, and therefore adds 5 to a roll of 1D10 when using his primary skill(s). Average contacts are trained, but are far from experienced. They add 10 to a roll of 1D10 when using skills. Professional contacts are masters of their occupations, and could make a comfortable living doing whatever it is they do. They add 15 to a 1D10 roll when using a skill. Experts are the best of the best, and people with their levels of skill are rare. They add 20 to a 1D10 roll when using a skill.

A contact's skill level may, at the GM's option, raise through game play. This, however, is one of the hardest elements to change about a contact, since it reflects his talent and skill.

**Contact Reputation Level**  

    Reputation	Cost
    0-2			0
    3-5			1
    6-8			2
    9-10		3

Reputation measures a contact's status in relation to what he does or is. The higher a contact's reputation, the more pull he may have in his business. While it can be seen as a measure of rank, it can also be a measure of how popular, famous, or well-respected a contact is.

A contact's reputation can change, just like a player character's can. This is usually accomplished by a raise in status, a promotion, or well-publicized activity involving the contact.


**Contact Availability Level**  

    Availability				Cost
    Seldom    (Must Roll 9+)    0
    Sometimes (Must Roll 7+)	1
    Often     (Must Roll 5+)	2
    Always    (Must Roll 3+)	3

Availability measures how often a contact can be called on to give a PC a helping hand. When attempting to get in touch with a contact, or see if he's available, roll 1D10 and compare to the "Must Roll" number. If the number equals or exceeds the number, the contact will be ready to assist. If not, he's out, and may (or may not) call back, at his convenience.

A contact may become more or less available depending on many aspects, including his schedule (busy contacts will be harder to reach), his willingness to deal with the PC (people who don't like you will tend to avoid talking to you), and constraints on his own private life (contacts who have been arrested or who are spending time in a hospital will be harder to get a hold of). Through normal game play, a GM can decide if a contact is more or less likely to be reached depending on the contact's life at the time. Contacts who have had good relationships, business or otherwise, with PCs will be more willing to talk or meet with them.

**Contact Reliability Level**  

    Reliability						Cost
    Unreliable     (Betrays On 3+)	0
    Reliable       (Betrays On 5+)	1
    Very Reliable  (Betrays On 7+)	2
    Super Reliable (Betrays On 9+)	3

Reliability is a measure of your contact's loyalty to you. In these times of changing loyalties and convenient friendships, it's nice to know who your real chums are. Reliability represents the likelihood that he will sell out to the opposition, reveal secrets about you to others, rat on you, lie to you, or otherwise turn against you. If a contact ever gets harassed by the police or (say) the mafia in regards to you, has a chance to sell you out for personal gain, or if his loyalty is compromised in any other way, the GM should secretly roll 1D10 and compare it to his "Betrays On" rating. If the number rolled equals or exceeds the number, the contact will betray you.

A contact's reliability may change, depending on his relationship with the PC. Sometimes, contacts are just untrustworthy bastards, and they won't go out of their way to protect the PC. A contact's reliability may fall in relation to a PC under several different circumstances, including overuse (the contact may feel used), and betrayal (such feelings may be caused by spreading the contact's name to your friends, or dropping his name to police under questioning). Reliability can be raised by bribing the contact, helping him out once in a while, or keeping in touch cordially.












### APPENDIX 3 - Cost Charts for the "Resources" Advantage
When creating a character with Resources, you must first decide which corporation the character is employed with. The breakdown for Resources has four different aspects, and each aspect (except for "Position") has five levels, rated zero through four. "Position" has ten levels, rated zero through nine. Choose which level you wish to have in each aspect, and add them together (with a minimum of 1 point). This will give you an SP cost between 1 and 16 (or up to 21, if Position is not restricted).

Depending on the character's affiliation with the company, and the company's relative strength, this number can be fairly high or fairly low. The levels of the separate aspects should be noted, and can only be changed through role-play. No IP may be spent to increase these levels. If not properly maintained, some levels may drop over the course of a game. Increases should be determined by both the GM as well as the player, although the GM's word is final in any dispute.

Position is a rough value, and equals a corporate's rank within his company. The monetary total listed is an approximate salary (in Eurodollars) earned per year as long as the company is doing well (see Financial Status). Position also defines what an employee can reasonably request, as far as company resources are concerned. This is largely up to the GM's interpretation, and should be based on the corporate's Respect, and both the company's Financial Status and Size. For example, the CEO of a local mom & pop company that is going bankrupt can't very well afford to keep a crack solo hit squad on retainer. GMs are encouraged to restrict characters from starting above Executive level.

Respect is an indication of how other employees in the company feel about you. The more people like you, the less likely they will be to stab you in the back, and the more likely they will be to lend aid and support your endeavors. However, no matter how highly people think of you, there is always someone willing to put a cold piece of steel between your shoulder blades.

Corporation Size should give you some idea of how many employees the company has working for it overall. This abstract total includes all employees worldwide, including troops, security, and covert agents.

Financial Status indicates how well the company is doing insofar as income is concerned. A company that is bankrupt or struggling will probably be more likely to lay employees off than one that is stable. Stable companies are making enough of a profit to pay all their employees, with a little left over. Thriving and prosperous companies are more likely to open new offices, expand their current product lines, and hire new employees. Also, each rating lists a pay multiplier, which is multiplied by the corporate's salary to get his total take per year. For example, an executive working for a thriving company makes a little over $90,000 per year, whereas his counterpart in a bankrupt company will be pulling in a little over $20,000 per year.

###APPENDIX 4 - More Information Concerning Specific Injuries and Their Effects
Injuries rolled that replicate certain disadvantages do not have to be "bought off " with IP in order to be cured. However, the injury can be "treated" during character creation, before play begins, but this may cost the character a quantity of money that the GM must determine based on the extent of the damage being repaired.

#### DETAILED INJURY LIST
##### Minor Burns
The character has received minor burns on one random body location. The burns healed properly and scarring is minimal. If hit location roll results in head/facial burns, reduce the character's ATT by -2.

##### Serious Burns
The character has been burned over a large part of his body. Roll 3 random locations. These areas are heavily scarred. If hit location roll results in head/facial burns, reduce the character's ATT by -2. If a particular location is rolled more than once, use the following guidelines :  
If the location is a limb, most of the muscle and sinew has been burned away. This leaves the limb useless. Any good medical professional would recommend amputation. If the location is the torso or abdominal areas, scarring is severe. Reduce BODY and REF by -2 each. If the location is the head/face, reduce ATT by -5 (to a minimum of 1). Character cannot grow hair.

##### Stab Wound(s)
The character has been stabbed or cut by an edged weapon. Other than leaving an impressive, albeit cosmetic, scar, the wound has no effect on game play. Refer to the "Impressive Scar" roll.

##### Bullet Wound : Went Clean Through
The character took a slug in a random body location, but it went right through him with very little tissue trauma. Character is scarred as per the "Impressive Scar" roll.

##### Bullet Wound : Lodged Projectile, Removed
The character was shot and the bullet lodged itself inside his body. Surgeons were later able to remove the projectile. The character possesses scars from the wound and the subsequent surgery on a random body location.

##### Bullet Wound : Lodged Projectile, Never Removed
The character was shot and the bullet lodged itself inside a random body location. However, due to one reason or another (the dangerous location of the wound, lousy medical care, etc.), the projectile was never removed. The bullet will show up on X-Rays, and may set off metal detectors.

##### Bullet Wound : Fragmented, Large Exit Wound
The character was shot in a random location yet again. This time, however, the round created a very large exit wound when it came tumbling out the other side. Either that, or the ammunition shot into the character was of some special nature (explosive, hollow point, glaser, etc.) which contributed to a large section of missing flesh. Whatever the cause, the character has a nasty scar. If the location rolled is a limb, it is useless. If the torso or abdomen are rolled, reduce the character's BODY by -1.

##### Poorly Healed Fracture
The character broke a bone in an arm or leg, and it healed poorly. All skill rolls made while using said limb are at -2. If the limb is a leg, reduce MA by -2 as well.

##### Damaged Internal Organs
Through one of the character's misdeeds he has damaged and/or lost an internal organ, or part of one. In the case of missing or partially missing organs, the character could have had a kidney or lung removed, as well as sections of severely damaged intestine, liver, stomach, whatever. The exact detrimental effects are up to player and GM, though losing points of the BODY attribute are a good place to start. For Example, someone with a reduced bladder may have to urinate frequently, or in worse cases, wear a catheter constantly, while people with one lung or kidney may function as normal, though missing a lung might reduce MA or BODY by a significant amount. Damaged organs, on the other hand, represent defective organs which may (or may not) last the character long, and will have to be replaced if they continue to degenerate.

##### Skull Fracture : Minor Brain Damage
The character bumped his head into something harder than his skull, resulting in minor brain damage (-1 INT).

##### Skull Fracture : Major Brain Damage
The character got whacked on the head really hard, resulting in major brain damage (-2 INT) and occasional blinding headaches (5% chance per day, non-cumulative).

##### Unremoved Shrapnel
The character, for whatever reason, is carrying around fragments of stuff in his body. This can include anything from small metal bomb casings, to buckshot, to pieces of shattered glass shards. Though not serious (yet), such things may pose problems later in life, as well as possibly setting off metal detectors.

##### Missing Teeth
The character is gotten some teeth knocked out. Roll 1d10 and consult the following chart to see how many are lost :
1-3 : One Tooth, 4-5 : Two Teeth, 6-7 : Three Teeth, 8 : Four Teeth, 9 : Five Teeth, 10 : Six Teeth. The character may have trouble chewing solid foods.

##### Missing Fingers/Toes
The character, through mishap or design, is missing 1d6 random fingers or toes on a hand or foot. Missing fingers can reduce REF when hand-eye coordination is needed, while missing over half the toes on one foot can reduce MA by -1.

##### Missing Eye
The character has lost vision in one of his eyes as per the -4 "Blind" disad.

##### Missing Ear
The character has lost an ear, or damaged his internal ear seriously enough to cause permanent damage. He suffers from the -4 "Hearing Loss/Deafness" disad.

##### Missing Nose
The character has either physically lost his nose (got it shot off, whatever), or severely damaged his sense of smell. In either case, he loses his sense of smell . In the case of actual physical nose loss, his ATT is modified by -2 as well.

##### Severed Limb/Hand/Foot
Through misfortune, disease, or injury, the character has lost a hand, foot, arm, or leg. Effects are per the "Missing Limbs" disad.

##### Back Injury
For one reason or another the character has acquired a serious back injury. He cannot lift heavy loads easily, and new injuries may aggravate the old one. For game purposes, the character is limited to using only half his BODY attribute when determining how much weight he can carry.

##### Impressive Scar
The character has received an impressive scar somewhere on his body. Although the injury causing the scar had little or no permanent effect, it acts as an "Unmistakable Feature" as per the disad of the same name.

#### APPENDIX 5 - Jailpath

You managed to pick up a sizeable debt this year (getting cigarettes, for bribing guards, maintaining your habbit, etc). You still owe D10 x 300 eb to someone who can collect even on the outside.

#### CYBERPUNK RED INTRO
The Jumpstart Kit is a starter box with streamlined rules
Just wanted to state up front that the full edition won't be published till late this year/early next year. So far the only Cyberpunk Red release has been the Cyberpunk Red Jumpstart Kit which is has been described as a streamlined version of the upcoming Cyberpunk Red rules to teach the core system and be quick and easy to run. It has a short intro adventure and a few screamsheets for further adventures. It uses pre-gen characters where the only customization is choosing/rolling a stat array and rolling up a custom lifepath. That said there are a few high level changes to highlight.

What's the same
The core resolution mechanic of Stat + Skill + 1d10 vs DC / opposed roll is still the core resolution mechanic for the system. Just about every complex, aggressive, or challenging/risky action a PC takes will involve a roll or multiple rolls, just like CP2020.

Roles will still have signature skills/abilities. For example the Netrunner pre-gen is specifically highlighted in the mechanics book (there is also a lore & adventure book) for the Interface skill and that skill being only available to netrunners.

Combat rolls, damage, and cover and suppression mechanics are similar to CP2020. Armor and wounds function similarly.

What's Different
Lifepath as presented in the Jumpstart Kit does not include any statistical bonuses or other mechanical outcomes. It is purely for character background and story hooks to inform both the GM and the PC's roleplaying.

While the core aspects of the combat system are the same or very similar to Friday Night Firefight in CP2020, the streamlining has removed or limited choices. You aren't rolling a hit location every time, hits are body head. The only special fire modes for automatic weapons are Burst and suppression fire.

Netrunning requires either direct physical or Local area network access and netrunning overall is a much faster, simpler affair. Story lore in the world book explains the world events that disabled a truly global network reverting things to local, disjointed networks. Netrunners take actions in real time with the party and get a certain amount of net actions to take per turn based on their interface level. Networks are set up as tower structures and you move from one level to the next facing the hazards, programs, ice, and interface options on each level as you go.

Cyber-psychosis and empathy cost for cyberware does not feature in the Jumpstart Kit. As the tools given are limited for runninng a long campaign with character's upgrading themselves this seems to be simply to focus on running the game than it no longer being an issue in the world of Cyberpunk. I fully expect this to be a part of the full rulebook.

Overall thoughts
The core feel of the game is maintained between CP2020 and the Red Jumpstart Kit. Weapons put out a good amount of damage, death saves are hard, and the core idea of fighting smart seems to still be the best approach to win a fight. The world is unfair and everyone is still out to make a buck. The screamsheets and intro adventure all feature the type of plots and characters that are directly from the CP2020 corebook and supplements. Times have changed, but the nature of the Cyberpunk world remains the same.

Make a Stun Save by rolling under the characterâ€™s Body Type on a ten sided die subtracting any modifiers from your current wound level. If failed, the character is stunned and can take no action until the player rolls a successful Stun Save. Limb Loss occurs if a limb takes more than 8 points of damage from a single attack. The character must make an immediate Death Save at Mortal 0. Head hits that inflict 8 points of undoubled damage kill automatically.

At Serious Wound Level the character is at -2 to his REF.

At Critical Wound Level the characterâ€™s REF, INT, and COOL are reduced to half rounded up.

At Mortal Wound Level the characterâ€™s REF, INT, and COOL are reduced to one-third rounded up and must make a Death Save.

Make a Death Save, if the character has been mortally wounded, by rolling under the characterâ€™s Body Type on a ten sided die subtracting the level of Mortality each round until they are stabilized with medical attention. Medical attention is defined as a successful First Aid skill check vs. the current damage taken. If the roll is successful, the character is stabilized and healing can commence.
